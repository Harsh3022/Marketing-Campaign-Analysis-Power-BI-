# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-Power-BI
I developed the Marketing Campaign Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to help businesses understand the effectiveness of their marketing strategies through data-driven insights. The project’s main goal was to analyze the performance of multiple marketing campaigns, measure conversion rates, track customer engagement, and calculate return on investment (ROI) to support smarter marketing decisions.

The dashboard consolidates campaign data from various sources, including email, social media, and digital ads, into a single, interactive interface. It provides a complete view of campaign performance using key metrics such as total leads generated, conversion rate, cost per acquisition (CPA), total campaign cost, and revenue generated.

Through visually appealing charts like bar graphs, funnel charts, donut charts, and line visuals, I was able to clearly represent campaign success trends and identify which marketing channels performed best. For example, the funnel visualization shows the customer journey from leads to conversions, helping marketers identify where potential customers drop off.

I used DAX formulas and data modeling in Power BI to create dynamic calculations and filters that allow users to analyze data by campaign type, time period, region, or marketing channel. These filters make it easy for decision-makers to focus on specific campaigns and gain actionable insights without technical complexity.

The project also includes KPIs such as ROI, conversion rate, and engagement score, allowing stakeholders to monitor performance at a glance. I further integrated trend analysis to help predict which campaigns are likely to yield the best results in the future.

Key Insights Provided:

Campaign performance by channel and time

Conversion rate and ROI tracking

Lead source effectiveness analysis

Cost vs. revenue comparison

Customer engagement and retention metrics

Tools Used: Power BI Desktop, Excel, Power Query, and DAX

Overall, this project helped transform raw marketing data into clear, actionable insights that can guide future campaign strategies and improve overall marketing effectiveness.
